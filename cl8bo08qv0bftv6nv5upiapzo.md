## DevOps Journey - Day 15 - GitLab, GPG & Bash

Hello, today was a busy day.
I started my Version Control module with some Git learning and bash exercises.

**Learned**:  
- ✅ **Git** - Learn the basics commands of Git with also some useful *git config* tweaks.
- ✅ **[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/devmentat)** - First time using GitLab, it’s less user-friendly than Github tho.
- ✅ **SSH & GPG** - I created my SSH keys for Gitlab and Github, and I also finally setup a GPG key for signing my commits.

**Pratice**:
- ✅ **[Bash Script](https://github.com/DevMentat/DevOps-BootCamp-Exercises)** - I started to work on my bash exercise, I have did the first one who was a script to install Java and check if it’s installed.
- 🟦  **Bash Script** - I have 7 others Bash exercises to do in the coming days.

Thanks for reading, don’t forget to follow my blog or connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/devmentat/) 😁.
Have a good day.
