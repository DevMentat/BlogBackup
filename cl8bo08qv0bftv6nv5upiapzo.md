Hello, today was a busy day. I started my Version Control module with some Git learning and bash exercises.

**Learned**:

* ✅ **Git** - Learn the basics commands of Git with also some useful *git config* tweaks.
    
* ✅ [**GitLab**](https://gitlab.com/devmentat) - First time using GitLab, it’s less user-friendly than Github tho.
    
* ✅ **SSH & GPG** - I created my SSH keys for Gitlab and Github, and I also finally setup a GPG key for signing my commits.
    

**Pratice**:

* ✅ [**Bash Script**](https://github.com/DevMentat/DevOps-BootCamp-Exercises) - I started to work on my bash exercise, I have did the first one who was a script to install Java and check if it’s installed.
    
* 🟦 **Bash Script** - I have 7 others Bash exercises to do in the coming days.
    

Thanks for reading, don’t forget to follow my blog 😁. Have a good day.
