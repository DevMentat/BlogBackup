# DevOps Journey - Week 8 - Nexus & Artifacts

Hello, little update for finishing this good week.
I mostly worked on the Nexus module who was longer than I thought, but I made it and have finished my month [goals](https://devmentat.com/my-devops-roadmap) in time 👌.

**Learned:**
- ✅ **Nexus Repository Manager** - I have completed this module and learned:
- ✅ Repository Types (Proxy, Hosted, Group) and how to manage them with secure roles and users
- ✅ Publish Artifact for Gradle and Maven projects
- ✅ Blob Store types and how to manage them
- ✅ Nexus REST API with listing, fetching and download [automation script](https://github.com/DevMentat/DevOps-BootCamp-Exercises/blob/main/6-artifact-repo/node-app-nexus.sh)
- ✅ Cleanup Policies and scheduled tasks

I didn't have much time left for Go Pratice...

I'm hyped to start Docker next week!

**Next Month:**
- Containers (Docker)
- Build Automation (CI/CD & Jenkins)
- AWS Services

Have a great week. 😁
