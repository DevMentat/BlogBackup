# DevOps Journey - Week 8-10 - Docker & More

Hello, this is a big weekly update because I have missed the two others. I have mainly worked on one bootcamp module, so I waited to finish it before making an update. My productivity was pretty slow in Week 8, but Week 9 and 10 were good.

**Learned:**
- ✅ **Docker** - I have completed this big module and learned:
   - ✅ Docker commands: With cli and Desktop GUI
   - ✅ Docker Run: How to run a container, with ports, networks and envs settings
   - ✅ Docker Compose: Create and manage a stack of containers
   - ✅ Docker Volumes: Creating persistent data for containers
   - ✅ Dockerize: Create an image from any app with base images and envs
   - ✅ Docker push: Upload an image to a cloud repo or Nexus with login
- 🟦 **Jenkins** - I just started the Jenkins module with setup and roles

**Pratice:**
- ✅ **[Docker Bootcamp Exercise](https://github.com/DevMentat/DevOps-BootCamp-Exercises):** I have run Mysql and PhpMyAdmin container with a local java app, and then dockerize the java app. At the end everything was running in a neat docker compose file on a cloud instance.

**Next Weeks:**
- Build Automation (CI/CD & Jenkins)
- AWS Services

Note: I created a DevOps Mastodon account, I am more active there than twitter because it corresponds more to my privacy value.

Thanks for the reading, have a good week. 😁
