## DevOps Journey - Day 13 - Linux Prerequisites Finished

Hello, today I have finally finished my Linux prerequisites for starting my DevOps learning.
Tomorrow I will start to work on the Git Versioning part!
I am one week late for my roadmap, hope I catch up 😅.

**Learned**:  
- ✅ **Shell Scripting** - I have completed the scripting part of the bootcamp, with function and loop and a backup project.
- ✅ **Environment Variables for DevOps** - I already knew Env for pentesting, but now I know how to use them for avoiding hardcoding login in a local app (for time or safety sake).

**In progress**: 
- 🟦 **Digital Ocean** - Configure a Droplet for my soon cloud training.

Thanks for reading and have a good day. ✌️
