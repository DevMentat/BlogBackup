# DevOps Journey - Week 5 - Git Practices & Databases

Hello Dev folks, I’m switching this series of post from daily to weekly, I found it more meaningful (and easier to keep up also). I have finished all my Bash module exercise and also my Git exercise. I’m starting the little Database module now. I have also updated the [Roadmap](https://devmentat.com/my-devops-roadmap) 😁.

**Learned:**

- 🟦 **Database** - “What type of DB use and when…”, Redis and MySQL. I have a few hours of class left on the matter for next week.

**Practice:**

- ✅ **[Bash](https://github.com/DevMentat/DevOps-BootCamp-Exercises)** - Finished the module with exercises 7 and 8.
- ✅ **[Git](https://github.com/DevMentat/DevOps-BootCamp-Exercises)** - Finished the whole module of 10 exercises on my [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/devmentatest/bootcamp-version-control-with-git).

Have a good day 👋
