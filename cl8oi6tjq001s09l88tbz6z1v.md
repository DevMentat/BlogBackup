## DevOps Journey - Day 22 - Git & Bash

Hello, quick update. 
This week was very slow because I caught the flu... but the good news is that I have finished the Git module. Now I'm working on bash and git exercises, then I will start docker.

**Learned**: 
- âœ… **Git Branches** - Merge, rebase, history, revert...

**Practice**:
- ðŸŸ¦ **[Bash Script](https://github.com/DevMentat/DevOps-BootCamp-Exercises)** - I'm working on other bash scripts exercises and git.

Have a good day.
