## DevOps Journey - Day 2 - Golang my new friend

Hi folks, today I learned more about the basics of Golang:

**Learned:**
✅ Formatted Output  ✅ Data Types ✅ Basic User Input ✅ Pointer ✅ Arrays ✅ Slice

**In progress:**
🟦 Loops  🟦 Conditionals

I don’t fully understand yet the *for loop*, and I have only started the *conditionals*. Plenty to do for tomorrow 😎.

**Current project**: https://github.com/DevMentat/booking-app-golang

Thx for reading and have a good day ✌️
