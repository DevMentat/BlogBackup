# DevOps Journey - Week 10-14 Jenkins Pipeline

Hello, this is a big monthly update because I have mainly focused on one long Bootcamp module. I wanted to finish it before sharing an update. Additionally, my productivity was slower at the end of the year due to the holiday season.

* Learned:
    
    * ✅ Jenkins - I have completed this big module and learned:
        
        * ✅ Jenkins installation and setup
            
        * ✅ Jenkins configuration and security
            
        * ✅ Jenkins pipelines and shared libraries
            
        * ✅ Jenkins jobs and stages
            
        * ✅ Jenkins integrations with GitLab and Docker
            
* Practice:
    
    * ✅ Jenkins Bootcamp Exercise: I created a Jenkins pipeline that builds and deploys a Node.js project. The pipeline consists of four stages: incrementing the version, running tests, building and pushing a Docker image, and committing the version update to the GitLab repository. Check out the code [here](https://gitlab.com/devmentat/node-project).
        

Next up, I'll be diving into AWS Services.

Thanks for reading and have a good week. 😁

P.S. Happy New Year to all! 🎉
