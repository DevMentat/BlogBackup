## DevOps Journey - Day 16 - Git Branches & Bash Scripts

Hi! Hope you have a good day, mine was productive.

**Learned**: 
- âœ… **Git Branches** - I learned how to create, delete and merge branches. I also learned about the advantage to use CI/CD instead of Main/Dev branches.
- ðŸŸ¦ ** Branch Rebase ** - I'm still learning how to rebase and merge without conflicts.

**Practice**:
- âœ… **[Bash Script](https://github.com/DevMentat/DevOps-BootCamp-Exercises)** - I have done the six more Bash exercise of my bootcamp. I will probably finish the last 3 tomorrow. I'm starting to like bash.

Thanks for reading ðŸ¤“
Have a good day.
