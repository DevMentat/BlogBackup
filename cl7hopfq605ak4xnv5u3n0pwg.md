# My DevOps Roadmap

Hello Iâ€™m DevMentat, and this is my personal DevOps Roadmap.
I will update it whenever I achieve a step on time or not, and also for adding details for the later step.

### My Background:
I come from a degree in Sys Admin and Network and I have studied for a year Cyber Security.
### My strategy:
I will first start with a DevOps bootcamp who is six months long, but Iâ€™m planning to finish it in five months or less. I know the bootcamp doesnâ€™t cover with depth all subjects, thatâ€™s why at the end of the bootcamp, I will take three additional months to study further the tools and technologies used by DevOps. I will mainly use videos and books while doing public projects for training purpose and also sharing my new skills.
### The Roadmap:
This roadmap starts now in September, my goal is to find a DevOps position in May or before.
I will detail my resources for the three deep learn months when I finish the bootcamp. But if you have good DevOps books that go into detail to recommend, I would be grateful.
