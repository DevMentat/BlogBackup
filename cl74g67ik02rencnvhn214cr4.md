## DevOps Journey - Day 1 - Starting Golang

Hi, I’m DevMentat! 
I am currently from an infosec background, and today I’m switching to DevOps. I’m excited to start this new journey.
I will publish my roadmap soon, but first I need to work on my prerequisite: my lack of programming skill.
I know a little bit of Python, but now, I have chosen to focus on Golang.

## Goal of the day:
- Learn the very basics of Golang with https://kubesimplify.com/lets-simplify-golang-part-1 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyUHQIec83I
- Setup my new DevOps social (if you see this post, I have succeeded)

Have a good day ✌️
