## DevOps Journey - Day 5 - Golang Pratice

Hi! Today I fully work on my little Golang project. My goal was to create a movie quiz with emojis as hints. I have created three levels of hints with reward points. I have not finished the project because it was too complex for my young coding skill. So I will improve it later.

âž¡ At the end my goal is to have the program randomly taking a movie from a list (or DB) before asking the user. If possible I will implement a score database (local).
This project can be a good training for working later on the dockerization and k8s.

ðŸŸ¦ Next week I will also start my DevOps study with Gitlab and CI/CD.

Thanks for reading and have a good weekend. ðŸ˜Ž
