# DevOps Journey - Week 6-7 - DB, Packages & Cloud

Hello, this is my update for the last two weeks.
My last week was very productive, I'm about to finish my monthly [roadmap](https://devmentat.com/my-devops-roadmap) in advance.

**Learned:**
- ✅ **Database** - I have finished the Database module. 
- ✅ **Build & Package Manager** - I have also finished this module, I learned about **artifacts**, **NPM**, **Maven** and **Gradle**.
- ✅ **Cloud & IaaS** - In this module I learn about the IaaS and how to create and manage a cloud instance with **Digital Ocean** (soon with AWS in a later module), and the best security practice (**firewall**, dedicated users…)
- 🟦 **Artifact Repo Manager** I’m currently learning how to setup and use **Nexus**.

**Practice:**
- ✅ **[Build & Package Manager](https://github.com/DevMentat/DevOps-BootCamp-Exercises)** - I build different **Java/Gradle** app for running them from the source code.
- ✅ **Cloud** - I setup a cloud server and run under a firewall a node app.
- ✅ **[Go Exercise](https://github.com/DevMentat/11-Go-Projects)** - I’m working on a set of 11 Go Exercises, I have finished the first one, a **web server**, and I’m working on the second one, a movie database.

Have a wonderful day 😁
