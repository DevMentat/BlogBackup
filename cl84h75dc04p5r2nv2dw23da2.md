## DevOps Journey - Day 12 - More Linux Prerequisites

👋 Hello, it's been a long time, I know.   
I’m still working on the DevOps Bootcamp prerequisite. I have not posted previous stuff because I was finding it too basic to share. But today I’m sharing what Linux basics I learned now. These are important things that I hadn’t thought to learn properly before, and this Bootcamp is the perfect occasion to brush up my Linux knowledge and skills.

**Learned**:  
- ✅ **Vim** - Finally I can ditch Nano
- ✅ **File Permissions** - I wanted to know all about it and not just chmod777 or google it
- ✅ **CLI Pipes** - That’s so useful, I wonder how I have not learned this before 

**In progress**: 
- 🟦 **Shell Scripting** - I already knew some basics, but it’s great to work on building automation that will help me as a DevOps (with Python & Go)

Thanks for reading and have a good day. ✌️
