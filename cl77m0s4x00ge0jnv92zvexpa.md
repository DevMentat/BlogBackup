## DevOps Journey - Day 3 - More Golang

Hello, today was a good day, I learn about a lot more of Golang stuff and I have been able to make my code clearer with external functions and multiple files.

**Learned**: âœ… Loops âœ… Conditionals âœ… Validate User Input âœ… Organizing with Functions âœ… Go Packages

**In progress**: ðŸŸ¦ Switch Statement

Tomorrow I will work on *Switch*, *Maps* and *Structs*.
